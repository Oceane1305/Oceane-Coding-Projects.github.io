My journey into coding began with curiosity and courage rather than experience. During my coding classes, I started building simple websites using HTML and CSS, learning how structure and design come together to create something meaningful on the screen. At first, every line of code felt new and challenging—but that challenge quickly turned into excitement.

Each project in this portfolio represents more than just a finished website; it reflects my willingness to learn, experiment, and improve. I focused on understanding the fundamentals—how clean HTML creates strong structure, how CSS brings personality through layout, color, and responsiveness, and how small details can completely transform the user experience.

What makes these projects special to me is not their complexity, but the growth behind them. With every website I built, I gained confidence in problem-solving, attention to detail, and creative thinking. I learned how to turn ideas into functional designs and how patience and consistency are just as important as technical skill. This portfolio is a snapshot of my early coding journey where learning meets creativity. It represents the foundation I am building as I continue to grow my skills, take on more advanced challenges, and expand my knowledge in web development. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and even more excited about where this journey is taking me next. 
Through hands-on projects, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for problem-solving, attention to detail, and continuous learning. Each project I work on represents growth—not just in technical skills, but in confidence and creativity.
