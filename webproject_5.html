    <p>I am a fan of Zeus in his movie and I love car. With this ads,they sent a starightforward message to people.</p>
            
    <p>Everyone’s favorite Greek god Zeus found his new favorite car. Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on the role of Zeus as he navigates life post retiring from Mount Olympus to Palm Springs. Zeus is struggling on land and beginning to lose “his spark” until his wife, Hera–played by Salma Hayek–reinvigorates his life when she introduces him to his new car, the all electric BMW iX.</p>
